# L2020FS
A JSON-based web filesystem simulation primarily made for [L2020OS](https://os.lampe2020.de) but because I couldn't find a working implementation anywhere I develop my own on GitHub so everyone can profit of this. 

### Why 4-space tabs?
I prefer 4-space tabs over 2-space tabs because 
1. I'm used to 4-space tabs because it was the default in most text editors I used so far.
2. 4-space tabs are more easily readable than 2-space tabs but still not as extreme as 8-space tabs.
